## Interesting features
1. **Lombok** - I used it to automatically generate the necessary standard methods, constructors for objects
2. **Hibernate** - I used it to simplify the interaction with the database, namely in particular for working with database objects as java objects)
3. **Liquibase** - I used it to ensure that when the application starts, there is always some identical list of people in the database
4. **JpaRepository** - I used it to simplify the interaction with the database, namely not to write queries to the database manually, but use JpaRepository methods and custom Query methods
